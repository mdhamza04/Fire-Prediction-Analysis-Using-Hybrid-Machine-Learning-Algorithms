# Fire-Prediction-Analysis-Using-Hybrid-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
They uphold the lifecycle of a diversity of creatures, including mankind. Destruction of such fire due to environmental hazards like forest fires is disastrous and leads to loss of economy, wildlife, property, and people. It endangers everything in its vicinity. Sadly, the presence of flora and fauna only increase the fire spread capability and speed. Early detection of these fires can help control the spread and protect the nearby areas from the damage caused. This research paper aims at predicting the occurrence of fires using Hybrid machine learning techniques. The idea is to apply multiple algorithms to the data and perform comparative analysis to find the best-performing model. The best performance is obtained by the machine learning model for this work.
